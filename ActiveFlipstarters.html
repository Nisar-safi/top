It was one of the first Woocommerce plugins to add support for Bitcoin Cash already in December 2017 and since then we have grown to nearly a thousand merchants that are utilizing CryptoWoo today. Cryptocurrency at its core is about privacy and true economic freedom and we respect those core values which is why we will never collect data about what products our customers sell, their customers, or any similar data. Our primary focus in this Flipstarter is the development of the plugin and the on-boarding of new merchants by providing them with all the benefits of Bitcoin Cash while also making the process of receiving payments in Woocommerce as simplistic and safe as possible.\",\"url\":\"https://funding.cryptowoo.com/\",\"status\":\"success\",\"funded_tx\":\"793a0503fbdfbfc0f4aac051de64fd0dabab4f455e6957502a279daa1961d189\",\"categories\":[{\"name\":\"Infrastructure\"},{\"name\":\"Software\"}],\"announcements\":[{\"url\":\"https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/pqldnj/cryptowoo_flipstarter_a_seamless_noncustodial_and/\"}],\"archives\":[],\"screenshots\":[{\"image\":\"http://flipbackend.bitcoincash.network/media/screenshots/cryptowoo-a-seamless-non-custodial-and-self-hosted-payment-gateway-for-wooco_8bd3uqV.png\",\"taken_at\":\"2021-09-20T08:57:20.683603Z\",\"taken_status\":\"success\"}]},{\"amount\":534000000,\"title\":\"Self-hosted / none-custodial, multi-crypto crowdfunding for freelance CyberPunks [on a budget]!\",\"description\":\"Self-hosted / none-custodial, multi-crypto crowdfunding for freelance CyberPunks [on a budget]!\",\"url\":\"http://167.172.143.11/\",\"status\":\"success\",\"funded_tx\":\"bac268e5103e6eb18a54a631200feb8a79a4da11f44c3f92671ae910e34da3a3\",\"categories\":[{\"name\":\"Crowdfunding\"},{\"name\":\"Adoption\"}],\"announcements\":[{\"url\":\"https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/pts51r/flipstarter_announcement_phase_2_nonecustodial/\"}],\"archives\":[],\"screenshots\":[{\"image\":\"http://flipbackend.bitcoincash.network/media/screenshots/self-hosted-none-custodial-multi-crypto-crowdfunding-for-freelance-cyberpunk_Dbr1dOk.png\",\"taken_at\":\"2021-09-26T15:31:16.959923Z\",\"taken_status\":\"running\"}]},{\"amount\":3500000000,\"title\":\"One Surgery Flipstarter 2: Advancing further and faster with Bitcoin Cash\",\"description\":\"ONE.SURGERY is a non-profit organisation that has been innovating with Bitcoin Cash at a phenomenal speed ever since our first Flipstarter campaign in November 2020.

Using it, you no longer need to run an indexing server alongside your node.\\r\\n- It's really cool gRPC API that makes accessing your node's data very easy.\\r\\n- BCHD being ready for Neutrino. Neutrino's use of client-side filtering means users no longer have to disclose their BCH addresses to a third party to find out if they have received a transaction.\\r\\n- etc\\r\\n\\r\\nFor reading more about the features mentioned and BCHD's other features, please visit [the website](https://bchd.cash/).\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately on the last network upgrade, BCHD went out of consensus so someone needed to step up to implement the new changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attempt to implement the upgrade has already been started.
